            <h2>2016 Brand Split and Smackdown Live</h2>

            <p>
                On July 19, 2016 WWE entered its second Brand Split era. The WWE Champion, Dean Ambrose, was drafted to Smackdown Live, and retained The Championship at the Battleground pay-per-view: defeating Roman Reigns and Seth Rollins in a triple threat match. As a result, the WWE Championship became exclusive property of Smackdown Live. Monday Night Raw, in turn, created its own championship: The WWE Universal Championship.</br> </br>

                Dean Ambrose engaged in a feud with Dolph Ziggler, which saw him emerge victorious and retain The Championship. At the No Mercy pay-per-view, in September, Ambrose faced AJ Styles and John Cena in a triple threat match. Styles emerged victorious to become the new WWE Champion, ending Ambrose's reign at 84 days </br></br>

                AJ Styles proceeded to feuded with Dean Ambrose, retaining the Championship. At The 2017 Royal Rumble pay-per-view, Styles faced 15-time champion John Cena. Cena defeated Styles to end his reign at 140 days, tying Ric Flair's record 16 title reigns, in the process.
